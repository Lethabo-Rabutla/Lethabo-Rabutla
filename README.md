# üí´ Hi there, I'm Lethabo

A motivated and experienced Computer Science graduate from Tshwane University of Technology, having completed all academic requirements and Work Integrated Learning (WIL), and currently awaiting graduation.

I bring hands-on experience in software development, mobile app creation, and backend systems ‚Äî developed through both academic projects and real workplace exposure. I‚Äôve worked with languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, and built full-stack applications using technologies such as PostgreSQL, React, and Java EE. I‚Äôm also proficient in web technologies (HTML, CSS) and database systems including Oracle SQL.

My passion lies in data engineering, where I aim to combine my technical background with my curiosity for data-driven problem-solving. I enjoy building and optimizing data pipelines, working with structured data, and contributing to solutions that make information useful and actionable.

I‚Äôm now ready to contribute to a professional team, apply what I‚Äôve learned, and continue growing in the field of technology ‚Äî especially within data-focused roles.
